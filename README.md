# Second Life: FBLA

For this year’s prompt, we were asked to create a sandbox game role-playing a year in the life of an FBLA student. Our game is required to have open gameplay mechanics meaning that the player can choose what they would like to do without restrictions. Our game’s purpose is to ultimately challenge players of any age to learn what an FBLA member does in addition to learning key business concepts through the game’s aesthetics, dynamics, and mechanics.  This can be achieved by competing in various competitions at the sectional, state, and national level.
